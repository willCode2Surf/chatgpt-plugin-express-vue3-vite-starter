## Summary

Getting lost in all of the frameworks and opinions about development experience is a complete distraction from the actual work that needs to get done. Very often it is necessary to have a boilerplate stack that lays out some simple structure while enabling all the modern tooling needed to build awesome apps.

This stack is a goto for me to clone and use a baseline application to rapidly create applications.

## Getting Started

Since this is a Node project, you must run the following command after cloning the repo:

```bash
npm install
```

Once the project has been cloned, and the dependencies have been installed we can run the application.

```bash
npm run start
```

If you want to use Docker it is just as easy. There is a known issue with using Husky and Docker. Since Husky and Prettier are geared for developer experience we can remove it for when we need to build the docker image. Just remove this section from the package.json file (inside the scripts portion).

```javascript
"prepare": "husky install"
```

Once that has been removed from the package.json file we can build the Docker image.

```bash
docker build -t boilerplate:dev .
```

once it is completed we can run the container image by executing the following docker command:

```bash
docker run -d -p 6909:6909 boilerplate:dev
```

This will build the distro content and run the server. The configuration details, including port number, can be modified in the /config folder.

### What it do

- Use Vue3 compisition API approach with Vite
- Express routes for backend calls
- Websocket support with composables
- Base starter spot for rapidly prototyping
- Prettier and Husky for clean code
- Containerized with Docker for distro

### What it does NOT do

- Use a ton of dependencies or additional frameworks
- Production ready, this can be promoted to a production stack with additional security work
